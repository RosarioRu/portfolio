  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My interest in programming began when I taught myself a little bit of Python in order to tutor my little sister who was failing her high school Computer Science class. I had no idea what coding <em>was</em>, let alone how much I would love it. My work after college centered around healthcare, as a scheduler, receptionist, and electronic health records trainer. Although I loved working with amazing people, I knew I was misisng something and tutoring my little sister made that clear. I was missing <strong>building complex things</strong> and tackling problems I could spend <strong>hours</strong> working at. This is what has lead me to pursue a new career in programming by taking classes at Epicodus.</p>
